<h1>Detection and Classification of Stress from Photoplethysmography Signals on Low-Cost, Resource-Constrained Sensor</h1>
<p align="justify">
  Mental stress adversely affects overall well-being, and prolonged exposure poses serious health risks, underscoring the need for wearable-based stress monitoring solutions. Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors are widely available, cost-effective, and already integrated into many commercial devices, making them a practical modality for stress assessment. This study proposes SADDNet, a lightweight deep learning framework for automatic stress detection from PPG signals, designed for deployment on low-resource devices. The model was trained and evaluated using subject-independent leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on two datasets: CATSA (50 subjects) and WESAD (15 subjects), achieving 92.25\% accuracy, 94.91\% F1-score, and 0.895 AUC, and 98.11\% accuracy, 97.33\% F1-score, and 0.989 AUC, respectively. Additionally, evaluation on PPG signals collected from a low-cost Max30102 sensor demonstrated 84.72\% accuracy, 85.71\% F1-score, and 0.876 AUC, validating the model’s robustness in real-world, resource-constrained scenarios. SADDNet outperformed several convolutional and transformer-based state-of-the-art models, requiring fewer parameters and faster inference. Cosine similarity-based explainability further confirmed that the model’s decisions aligned with physiological insights. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, efficient, and low-cost real-time stress monitoring using wearable devices.
